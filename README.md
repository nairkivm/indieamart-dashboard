## Description

This is a mini data project in attempt to accomplish [**Pelajar Data Challenge #1**](https://x.com/as_sulthoni/status/1765027539523952943?s=20). The objective is **to gain any interesting insights that can be provided to a C-Level of Indiemart**. The requirements are detailed in this [post](https://x.com/as_sulthoni/status/1765027539523952943?s=20).
